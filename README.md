The "Bank Management ATM Simulator" is a Java-based application that replicates key features of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). 
It allows users to create and manage bank accounts through a secure signup and login system. Once logged in, users can perform various transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. 
The system also provides detailed transaction history, allowing users to track their activities.
In addition to basic banking operations, the simulator includes functionality for PIN management, enabling users to change or update their PIN for added security. 
The application ensures a smooth and seamless user experience with a graceful exit option, allowing users to securely log out and close the session. 
This project offers a comprehensive simulation of ATM features and banking processes, making it an excellent tool for understanding basic banking operations.
